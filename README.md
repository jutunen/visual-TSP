# visual-TSP
Visual-TSP - a web application for [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) visualization and solving.

##Client Installation

Edit *build.sh* Bash script and set TARGET_DIR as you wish.

*Visual-tsp.js* file is a result of compilation from *visual-tsp-jsx.js* file.  
*Visual-tsp.js* is a precompiled file, but if a recompilation is needed, a compiler such as [Babel JS](https://babeljs.io/) is required for React JSX compiling.  
To start experimenting with TSP, open *visual-tsp.html* in your browser.  
Make sure your browser is up-to-date enough to be able to handle [ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla).

##Server Installation

Client side application contains a TSP solver, but server side calculation is recommended for smoother UX.  
'servers' directory contains TSP solver implementations for Python and Node.js.

Python application is based on Tornado server, see http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ for installation instructions.  
Once you have Tornado installed, start the server with command **python3 tsp-solver.py**

Node.js application is based on [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [express-ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ws) and [permutation-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/permutation-engine).  
Install tsp-solver.js with command **npm install**  
Start the server with command **node tsp-solver.js**

##TSP solving algorithms

Currently all implementations use brute force search to find the shortest routes. Brute force search is very ineffective way to solve a TSP and therefore the maximum count of "cities" is limited to 9.

##3rd party libraries

This project includes a permutation-engine.js file from https://github.com/eriksank/permutation-engine

Following libraries are utilized via CDN:

oCanvas - Canvas drawing made easy http://ocanvas.org/  
Redux - Application state container http://redux.js.org/  
React - For listing the coordinates etc. https://facebook.github.io/react/  
jQuery - For generic DOM manipulation etc. http://jquery.com/

##Contributing

Server implementations with different TSP solving algorithms are welcome. Each server should have their own directory under servers directory. Directories should be named with following naming convention: *implementationLanguage-algorithmName*
